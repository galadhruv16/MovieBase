# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


 # App Requirements

 Task 2: Create a web application that allows users to search for movies and view detailed information about them. The application should fetch data from an external movie database API (e.g., OMDB API, The Movie Database API).
https://www.omdbapi.com/, https://www.themoviedb.org/

Requirements:

 - Implement a user interface that allows users to search for movies by title.
 - Display a list of search results with basic movie information (title, year, poster).
 - Allow users to click on a movie to view detailed information (plot, director, cast, ratings, etc.).
 - Provide a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
 - Tech Stack choice is yours, either HTML, CSS, JS or ReactJS.
Study the documentation and use the links provided to get the api.
